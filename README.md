# Hello-World
Everybody has to start with something

Indeed everybody has to start somewhere,
Hello my fellow humans!
FabGtte here, with a not so fascinating story to tell about, well, myself
I am currently a complete newbie to programming but focusing on sharpening my skill box on daily basis. 
I started by learning HTML and next on my list are CSS, PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby and Ruby-on-roads.
Hopefully in about 6 months I'll be able to code descently enough to undergo medium sized projects be it on web-developpment or other!
If I manage to consider myself a full stack web developper by the end of the year, then my objective will be more than completed.
That's it for now my fellow terrians.
FabGtte Out!
